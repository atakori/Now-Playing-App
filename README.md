Now Playing

--Summary -- 
Now Playing is an app for people who just can't decide on what movie to watch. 
Whether that's by indecisiveness or the fact that there are hundreds of movies out there, 
we won't judge! As a random movie generator, Now Playing selects movies based off of a user 
selected genre to give you movie information, trailers, ratings, and reviews to help you find 
your next favorite movie that you never knew existed. It'll even give you a movie with a 
random genre if you want!

Now Playing also features a watchlist feature which gives users the ability to create a custom
list of discovered movies that they would like to view movie information for again while still 
searching for new movies.
